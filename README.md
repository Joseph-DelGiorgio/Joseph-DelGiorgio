- 👋 Hi, I’m @Joseph-DelGiorgio (age: 20)
- 😎 I’m interested in working on any/all blockchain applications within the ethereum ecosystem. I am loooking to apply my skills to writing smart contracts and working in venture capital. My career goal is to start a crypto-native regenerative venture fund that aligns/create symbiotic relationships between the environment, imporverished, and technology.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and Solidity.
- 💁 I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything, my eyes/ears are always open! While I am somewhat of a novice, I am looking to progress by coding every single day. I truly believe that smart contracts will have one of the most profound changes we have ever seen. There are so many 3rd parties in just about every facet of life, I know smart contracts will change that and I want to be apart of it. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... feel free to reach me on email: jojodelg@gmail.com. You can also reach me on twitter and instagram @joedelgiorgio.eth
